## Usage 
Upon loading, you will see the portal page which will allow a user to login or sign up for an account. Once logged in, a user will be redirected to the Home page which will display a news feed of goals other users have accomplished along with a leaderboard that displays the Top 25 users with the highest points. There is also the functionality to search other users that you can follow and check out their healthy goals to get some ideas. 

Clicking on My Profile will navigate you to your user profile where you can edit your About Me section and change your profile icon. On your profile, you are able to set daily goals to help you live a healthier lifestyle. Upon completing a healthy goal, you will earn points that you can later redeem at the Shop to purchase a different icon. Crush your goals and rack up the points to make it on the leaderboard.
